## Overview
Thank you all for a great event! We had an amazing turnout with 40 participants signed up and 11 teams competing! Each project was a success in some way and I don't think anyone failed at accomplishing something amazing. We hope that all participants had fun, learned something new, and are ready for whatever's next!
