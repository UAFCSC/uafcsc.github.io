## Summary
The UAF Cyber Security Club will be hosting its first ever hackathon on November 10th. This event will be a chance for all students, regardless of discipline, to come together and build whatever they can imagine. There will be lots of food, swag, and prizes during this fun and fast paced weekend, so come up with an idea for yourself or a small team, sign up [here](https://goo.gl/forms/L18cLToAfNcu6OrF3), and get ready!

## Rules
In order to not limit creativity, there will not be many rules for the event. Projects of any nature will be accepted as long as they:
  1. Have some internet connected component. This could mean they are entirely based on the internet, like an online game, or are controlled by an internet connected device, like in the case of a smart toaster.
  2. Are participant built during the competition. This rule is mainly to prohibit just assembling things from kits, but is overall not too stringent. If you have a great idea and are excited to get started on it, feel free to do some research before the event. However, for fairness in the competition we ask that you take full advantage of this weekend to implement your idea.

## Questions?
Any questions regarding the event can be directed to [Ryan Stonebraker](mailto:rastonebraker@alaska.edu) or [Tristan Van Cise](mailto:tvancsise@alaska.edu).
