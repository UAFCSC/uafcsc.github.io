## Summary
The UAF Cyber Security Club will be hosting its first ever hackathon on November 10th. This event will be a chance for all students, regardless of discipline, to come together and build whatever they can imagine. There will be lots of food, swag, and prizes during this fun and fast paced weekend, so come up with an idea for yourself or a small team, sign up [here](https://goo.gl/forms/L18cLToAfNcu6OrF3), and get ready!

## Schedule
The hackathon will run from 9 am on Saturday, November 10th to 3:30pm on Sunday, November 11th. Project presentations will occur at 4pm Sunday (just give us an informal, rough overview and demonstration of your project). Finally, winners will be announced at 5pm so stick around!

## Categories
The goal of this competition is to be open ended and as encompassing of all ideas as possible. With that being said, there will be three main categories for the hackathon listed below.

- **Internet of Things**  
  This category encompasses all projects with an internet connected component to them. This could be anything from a smart toaster to an internet connected drone. The idea of this category is to encourage participants to think outside of the box and come up with both new ways to control things and new things to control.

- **Robotics**  
  This category includes all things robotics. While this category has significant overlap with the Internet of Things category, projects do not necessarily have to have a network connected component to them. Projects in this category will be judged based on their uniqueness, function, and design.

- **Games**  
  What defines a game? Is it something you play in a web browser on a computer? Or could games exist in other mediums as well? This category aims to find out. Projects in this category should be technology related (ie. have either a software or hardware component to them) and participants should think outside of the box to come up with novel concepts for game play, controls, and human-computer interactions.

## Judging
All categories will have at a minimum one winner. The winner will be decided on the second day (November 11th) at 5pm. Various things will be looked at for each of the individual categories defined above, but overall, creativity and execution of the idea will be heavily weighted.

## Prizes
Thanks to our sponsors at CEM and EPSCoR, we are proud to announce that we will be able to offer prizes for all winners of each category. These prizes will include the Creality Ender 3 3D Printer, the DJI Tello Quadcopter, and Anker 20,000 mAh battery packs.
