The University of Alaska Fairbanks Cyber Security Club is a fun and fast-paced student organization dedicated to learning about and teaching Cyber Security concepts. We annually compete in the [Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](https://www.nationalccdc.org/) and have won the regional At-Large event 4 times since 2014. In addition to this event, we compete in Capture the Flag events such as [CSAW](https://ctf.csaw.io/) and frequently host our own CTF's for members to get practice competing in. Come join our discord server to stay up to date on CSC meetings and happenings: https://discord.gg/PhPDzNX.
